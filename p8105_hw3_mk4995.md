## Problem 2

*Start by organizing the datasets - load, clean, merge, and organize
into a final `merged_df` dataset.*

``` r
# Import and clean nhanes_accel.csv
accel_df = 
  read_csv("data/nhanes_accel.csv") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  pivot_longer(
    min1:min1440,
    names_to = "minute_interval",
    names_prefix = "min",
    values_to = "mims"
  ) # Pivot these columns 

covar_df = 
  read_csv("data/nhanes_covar.csv", skip = 4) |> # skip first 4 rows
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  drop_na(sex, age, bmi, education) |> # drop N/A rows from demographic data
  filter(!(age < 21)) |> # filter out people younger than 21
  mutate( # encode variable with reasonable names
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "Male",
      2 ~ "Female"
    ),
    education = case_match(
      education, 
      1 ~ "Less than high school",
      2 ~ "High school equivalent",
      3 ~ "More than high school"
    ),
    education = factor( # create factor variable
      education,
      levels = c("Less than high school", "High school equivalent", "More than high school")
    )
  )

merged_df = left_join( # merge datasets using a left join so it only includes the data specified from the covar_df
  covar_df, 
  accel_df, 
  by = "seqn"
)
```

*Produce a reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each
education category.*

``` r
# Create reader-friendly table for the number of men and women in each educ category
merged_df |> 
  distinct(seqn, .keep_all = TRUE) |> # keep all columns but identify unique seq numbers
  group_by(education, sex) |> # group by education and sex 
  summarize(count = n()) |> # get male/female counts
  pivot_wider( # make more reader friendly (male/female)
    names_from = sex,
    values_from = count
  ) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'education'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| education              | Female | Male |
|:-----------------------|-------:|-----:|
| Less than high school  |     28 |   27 |
| High school equivalent |     23 |   35 |
| More than high school  |     59 |   56 |

Thee are about the same number of female and male participants in each
education category except there are far more males in the high school
equivalent group.

*Create a visualization of the age distributions for men and women in
each education category.*

``` r
merged_df |> 
  distinct(seqn, .keep_all = TRUE) |> # keep all columns but identify unique seq numbers
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_histogram(position = "dodge", bins = 10) +
  facet_grid(. ~ education) + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    title = "Age Distribution by Sex and Education Level",
    fill = "Sex"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10))
```

There is a concentration of female participants in their 40s and 50s
belonging to the more than high school category, while fewer women in
the same age group have lower education levels. For males, there is a
more even distribution across all ages, but there is a higher
concentration of individuals in their 30s and 40s with more than a high
school education. Overall, both men and women with higher education
levels are distributed more evenly across various age groups, while
those with less education are less represented, particularly at younger
ages.

*Using your tidied dataset, aggregate across minutes to create a total
activity variable for each participant.*

``` r
merged_df |> 
  group_by(seqn, sex, age, education) |> 
  summarize(
    total_mims = sum(mims, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> 
  distinct(seqn, .keep_all = TRUE) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_mims, color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(. ~ education) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    title = "Total Activity over the Day",
    color = "Sex",
    x = "Age",
    y = "Total Activity (mins)"
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'seqn', 'sex', 'age'. You can override
    ## using the `.groups` argument.
    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'

Females tend to have a higher total activity level than males in all
panels. Overall, in all education categories, there is a general decline
in total activity as age increases, especially noticeable after the age
of 60. This trend is consistent for both males and females, with some
fluctuations before age 60 depending on the education level. Individuals
with higher education tend to show a more gradual decline in activity
compared to those with less education.

``` r
merged_df |> 
  group_by(sex, education) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = minute_interval, y = mims, color = sex)) +
  geom_line(se = FALSE) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ education)
```

    ## Warning in geom_line(se = FALSE): Ignoring unknown parameters: `se`
